        {
          question: "What materials are used in your art prints?",
          answer: "Our prints emerge from a harmonious fusion of archival-grade papers and vibrant pigment inks that dance with light. We select only premium materials that ensure your artwork maintains its radiance and essence for generations, with each piece carrying the energetic quality of museum-standard presentation."
        },
        {
          question: "Are the prints limited editions?",
          answer: "Yes, our prints exist as finite expressions in the material realm. Each edition is mindfully limited to preserve its uniqueness and value, with each print individually numbered and accompanied by a certificate of authenticity that validates its place in the cosmic sequence."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I purchase a digital version of the artwork?",
          answer: "Currently, we offer only physical manifestations of our creative expressions. The tangible presence of art creates a different resonance within your space than digital forms, though we're exploring future possibilities for digital editions."
        },
        {
          question: "Do you offer custom sizes for the prints?",
          answer: "Yes, we can accommodate your spatial requirements. Please contact us with your desired dimensions, and we'll create a personalized quote for your custom-sized print that aligns perfectly with your environment."
        },
        {
          question: "Are the colors on the print exactly as shown on the website?",
          answer: "While we strive for precise representation, the digital realm and physical world sometimes interpret colors differently. Our professional calibration minimizes these variations, but subtle differences may occur due to screen settings and the natural properties of pigment on paper."
        },
        {
          question: "How are the prints packaged to ensure they arrive safely?",
          answer: "Each print undertakes its journey to you in protective materials - acid-free tissue, rigid cardboard backing, water-resistant outer packaging, and reinforced corners. We treat each shipment as a sacred vessel carrying creative energy to your doorstep."

        },
        {
          question: "When will my order ship?",

        },
        {
          question: "Will I get a tracking number?",
          answer: "Yes, you'll receive a digital thread to follow your art's journey. Once your order ships, we'll send tracking information to your email address, allowing you to witness its progress toward you."
        },
        {
          question: "How long does shipping take?",
          answer: "Shipping times vary by destination. Domestic deliveries typically arrive within 3-7 business days after shipping, while international journeys may require 7-21 days depending on customs processing and local delivery services."
        },
        {
          question: "What shipping carriers do you use?",

        },
        {
          question: "Can I exchange a print for a different artwork?",
          answer: "Yes, exchanges are possible within our 30-day return window. Contact us to initiate the exchange process, and we'll guide you through returning your current print and selecting your new artistic connection."
        },

        },
        {
          question: "Will I receive a refund for the shipping costs?",

        },
        {
          question: "Is my payment information secure?",
          answer: "Absolutely. Your financial information travels through encrypted pathways and secure processing systems. We never store your complete card details in our database, honoring both your trust and privacy."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I pay in installments or use a payment plan?",

        },
        {
          question: "How do I apply a discount code?",
          answer: "During the checkout journey, you'll find a field labeled 'Discount Code' where you can enter your code. The system will automatically adjust your total to reflect the appropriate discount before finalizing your purchase."

      items: [
        {
          question: "How do I care for my art print?",
          answer: "Treat your print as a living entity deserving mindful attention. Display away from direct sunlight, extreme temperature fluctuations, and moisture. When handling, touch only the edges with clean hands, acknowledging the sensitive nature of fine art papers."
        },
        {
          question: "What is the best way to frame the prints?",
          answer: "We recommend professional framing with acid-free mats and UV-protective glass to preserve the print's vibrancy. This creates both physical protection and an energetic boundary that honors the artwork's presence in your space."
        },
        {
          question: "Will the colors fade over time?",
          answer: "Our archival pigment inks are designed to resist fading for many cycles of the sun. Under proper care and display conditions, the prints will maintain their vivid essence for 80-100 years, allowing generations to experience their beauty."
        },
        {
          question: "How should I clean the print if it becomes dusty?",
          answer: "For framed prints behind glass, simply use a lint-free cloth with glass cleaner applied to the cloth (never directly to the glass). For unframed prints, gently dust using a clean, soft brush designed for artwork, always moving from the center outward with minimal pressure."
